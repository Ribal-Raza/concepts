const id = 12223;
let email = "raza@yahoo.net";
var password = "";
city = "Multan";

// id = 23335; this can't be done because 'const' cannot be changed
// 'var' has problems related to scopes (function and block scope) so it is recommended to not use it.
// using 'let' instead of 'var' is a good practice
// variables can also be declared without 'let' or 'const' but its a bad practice
